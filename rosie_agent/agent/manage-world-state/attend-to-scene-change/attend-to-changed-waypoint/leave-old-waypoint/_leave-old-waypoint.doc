##### Superoperator Rep #####

^old-waypoint - reference to the waypoint we are leaving 
	from top-state.world.maps.map.waypoint

##### Substate Results ######

Removes ^current-waypoint from world.robot
Removes old objects from the world state
Makes sure proper information is stored in epmem for future use

###### State Representation #####

^old-waypoint - reference to the waypoint we are leaving 
	Elaborated from superstate.operator.old-waypoint
	
^old-location - the location we are leaving (if any)
	Elaborated from world.robot.current-location

^confirmed-object <obj> - all world objects with predicates.is-confirmed1 confirmed1
	(We for sure saw them in the old location at some point)

^unconfirmed-object <obj> - all world objects with predicates.is-confirmed1 not-confirmed1
	(We never saw them in the old location)

^confirmed-objects true - Flag is present if there is at least 1 confirmed-object
^unconfirmed-objects true - Flag is present if there is at least 1 unconfirmed-object

^position-filter - svs filter of type node_position
^rotation-filter - svs filter of type node_rotation
^scale-filter - svs filter of type node_scale
	A set of these filters is created for each confirmed object and placed on the top-state.svs.command link
	These are used so the metric info of each object is stored in epmem
	Result of extract-metric-info
^extracted-metric-info true - Flag created once the results of the filters are present


###### Operators + Order #####

# remove-unconfirmed-objects
	For each unconfirmed object - delete from working memory 
	We don't want information about them in our episodic memory snapshot
	This will probably cause the substate to retract while the objects are delete
		(creates a delete-object change on the perception-monitor.changes)

# extract-metric-info
	For each confirmed object, create svs filters to get the metric info (pos/rot/scale)
		And copy onto the world object so its included in episodic memory snapshot

# remove-old-information
	Removes all objects from the world
	Removes current-waypoint and current-location from robot
