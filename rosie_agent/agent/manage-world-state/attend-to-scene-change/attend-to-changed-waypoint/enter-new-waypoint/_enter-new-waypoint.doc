##### Superoperator Rep #####

^new-waypoint - reference to waypoint being entered
	from top-state.maps.map.waypoint

##### Substate Results ######

Creates ^current-waypoint and ^current-location (if one) on world.robot (substate will retract)
	Adds new location to world 
	Adds retrieved episodic memory objects to world 


###### State Representation #####

^new-waypoint - reference to the waypoint being entered
   from top-state.maps.map.waypoint

^new-location - reference to the location being entered (if any)
   from top-state.world.objects.object

^new-location none - flag present if no location includes the current waypoint

^retrieved-location <lti>
^retrieved-location none
	One of these is created as the result of the smem-query
	
^retrieved-episode <episode>
^retrieved-episode none
	One of these is created as the result of retrieve-previous-episode

###### Operator Info ######

# smem-query - If there is no location listed, try looking one up from semantic memory
	With the given waypoint handle under it
	Produces retrieved-location <lti> or retrieved-location none

# add-location-to-world - takes the result of the smem-query
	And adds it to the world through perception-monitor.changes.new-object
	
# retrieve-previous-episode - does an episode memory retrieval
	To find an episode from the last time we were at that location
	Results in either retrieved-episode <episode> or retrieved-episode none

# add-new-information - Creates new information on the top-state, including:
	Adding current-waypoint and current-location (if any) to world.robot
	Adding objects from episode memory result to working memory
	Marks the new location as visible
