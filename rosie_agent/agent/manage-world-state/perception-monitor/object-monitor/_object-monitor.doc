############## elaborate-object-info.soar ############

Elaborates substructure of object-monitor/object-info

# REQUIRED #

object-handle <handle> 
	The handle of the object, must be there on creation
	
perception-id <id> 
	The id for the perception object in svs, must be there on creation

belief-id <id> 
	The id to use on the belief object in svs, must be there on creation

# ELABORATED #

status <status> 
	Contains wmes for monitoring object status (see elaborate-object-status.soar)

differences <diffs> 
	Contains wmes for monitoring differneces between perception and belief (see elaborate-object-differences.soar)

properties <props> 
	Contains wmes for monitoring object properties from perception (see elaborate-object-properties.soar)

perception-obj <obj> 
	Reference to the perceptual object in svs (matches perception-id)

belief-obj <obj> 
	Reference to the belief object in svs (matches belief-id)

input-link-obj <obj> 
	Reference to the object representation on the input-link (matches object-handle)

wm-obj <obj> 
	Reference to the object representation in working memory (top-state.world.objects.object <obj>)
	(matches object-handle)
	
check-stability-time <t>
    The time to check whether a new object has been stable (hasn't moved/grown/shrunk much)

check-occlusion-time <t>
    The time to recheck whether the object is still occluded
    
check-growth-time <t>
    The time to recheck if the object has still grown 


######### elaborate-object-status.soar ##########

Elaborates object-info.status <status>

in-view << true false >>
	True if the belief object intersects the robot's view volume
	(The object should be in view)
	
is-visible1 << visible1 not-visible1 >>
	True if the object is visible (coming in on perception)
	
is-occluded << true false >>
    True if the object is being occluded

stability-timer-expired true    
    True if object-info.check-stability-time has passed
    
occlusion-timer-expired true    
    True if object-info.check-occlusion-time has passed
    
growth-timer-expired true   
    True if object-info.check-growth-time has passed
	
	
######## elaborate-object-properties.soar ########

Elaborates object-info.properties <props>

Each att/val pair on input-link-obj.classifications <cls>
	is copied onto this id
	

####### elaborate-object-differences.soar ########

Comparing Positions:
	If there is both a belief-obj and perception-obj
	Creates a extract distance filter on the top-state.svs.command link (^compare-position)
	Elaborates the result as ^pos-diff <val>
	
Comparing Volumes:
    If there is both a belief-obj and perception-obj
    Creates an extract volume filter for the belief object and perception object (^belief-vol, ^perception-vol)
    Elaborates ^vol-diff <diff> as (perception volume)/(belief volume)
	
has-moved true
	Created if pos-diff > agent-params.pos-diff-threshold
	
has-grown true
    Created if vol-diff > agent-params.vol-high-diff-threshold
	
has-shrunk true
    Created if vol-diff < agent-params.vol-low-diff-threshold

	
####### elaborate-change.soar ######

Lists the types of object changes that can occur, and the rules to detect those changes

Change: new-object [attend-to-new-object]
	Occurs when a new perception object comes in on the svs link
	^perception-obj - root identifier of the svs object
	
Change: newly-visible-object [attend-to-newly-visible-object]
	Occurs when the object is visible but noted as not visible in working memory
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change newly-not-visible-object [attend-to-newly-not-visible-object]
	Occurs when the object is no longer visible but noted as visible in working memory
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change moved-object [attend-to-moved-object]
	Occurs when there is a ^has-moved true flag under ^differences
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change update-pose [update-object-pose]
	Occurs when there is an ^update-pose true flag on the object-info
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change missing-object [attend-to-missing-object]
	Occurs when an object is in-view but not visible (under ^status)
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change delete-object [delete-object]
	Occurs when there is a ^delete-object true flag on the object-info
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure

Change new-object-predicate [attend-to-new-object-predicate]
	Occurs when a predicate is under ^properties that is not on the wm-obj structure
	^object-info - reference to the object-info structure
	^property-handle - name of the property
	^predicate-handle - name of the predicate
