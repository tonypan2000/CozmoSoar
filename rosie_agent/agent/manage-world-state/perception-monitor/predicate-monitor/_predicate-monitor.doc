####### extract-relations.soar #######

Given an object and a relation predicate handle
This code will take care of creating the svs filters needed
to extract the relation
It will return all objects that are in the given relation
with the given object
(E.G. given obj7 and relation 'on', returns all objects on obj7)

To use, simply create the following structure on top-state
(state <s> ^perception-monitor.predicate-monitor <mon>)
(<mon> ^predicate-info <pred-info>)
  (<pred-info> ^predicate-handle <pred-handle>
               ^object-test <test>)
    (<test> ^object <obj>)

Result: Extracts the relations through SVS and will copy all different matching world objects
      as object-test.match <obj> 
 
####### retrieve-predicate-info.soar #######

Given a predicate-info with a predicate-handle
   Will use the handle to retrieve the predicate information 
   from semantic memory

Result: creates predicate-info.smem-info <LTI>
