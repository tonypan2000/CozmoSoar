# Desc: This operator is proposed in the interpret substate,
#       but it is given a worst preference.
#       Thus it will not be selected until after all other
#       operators needed in the interpret state
#       have completed.
#

#    Propose an operator to finish up the interpret state
sp {interpret*propose*interpret-done

-->
   (<s> ^operator <o> + <)
   (<o> ^name interpret-done
        ^debug-info (concat |All decision making is done.| ))

#   This one fires when an action was decided on
#	It may fire several times
