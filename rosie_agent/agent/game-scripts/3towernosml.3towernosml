The name of the puzzle is tower-of-hanoi-3.
load init-tower3nosml.
ok.
you can move a clear block onto a clear object that is larger than the block.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if the volume of a block is more than the volume of an object then the block is larger than the object.
avoid moving a block that was previously moved.
load final-tower3nosml.
The goal is that a small block is on a medium block and the medium block is on a large block and the large block is on a blue location.
if the volume of a block is less than one then the block is small.
if the volume of a block is more than one and the volume of the block is less than three then the block is medium.
if the volume of a block is more than three then the block is large.
ok.
done.
load init-tower3nosml.
yes.
