If a frog-covered location is to the right of a toad-covered location and the toad-covered location is to the right of an available location then you can move a block on the frog-covered location onto the available location.
if a location is below a red block then the location is frog-covered.
if a location is below a blue block then the location is toad-covered.
if a toad-covered location is to the left of a frog-covered location and the frog-covered location is to the left of an available location then you can move a block on the toad-covered location onto the available location.
