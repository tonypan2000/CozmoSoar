load init-tower3.
ok.
you can move a clear block onto a clear object that is larger than the block.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if the volume of a block is more than the volume of an object then the block is larger than the object.
avoid moving a block that was previously moved.
load third-tower3.

load final-tower3.
The goal is that there are two clear green locations.
ok.
