the name of the puzzle is number-map-colorv.
load init-map-ncolor.
ok.
you can write a number that is between zero and four onto an empty location.
if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty.
load fail-map-ncolor.
if the value of a location is the value of an object that is next to the location then you lose.
ok.
load init-map-ncolorv.
prefer writing a number onto an empty location over writing a number onto an empty object that is higher than the location.
if the volume of a location is more than the volume of an object then the location is higher than the object.
the solution has seven steps.
load final-map-ncolor.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
ok.
done.
load init-map-ncolorv.
yes.
