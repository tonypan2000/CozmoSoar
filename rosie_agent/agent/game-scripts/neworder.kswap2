the name of the puzzle is knight-swap.
load init-kswap.
ok.
if a clear location is jumpable by a block then you can move the block onto the clear location.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if an object that is adjacent to a block is diagonal with a location that is not next to the block then the location is jumpable by the block.
the solution has eight steps.
load final-kswap.
the goal is that all the red blocks are on the red locations and all the blue blocks are on the blue locations.
ok.
done.
load second-kswap.
