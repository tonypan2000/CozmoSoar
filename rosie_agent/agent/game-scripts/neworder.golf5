the name of the puzzle is golf-solitaire.
load init-golf-sol.
ok.
you can move a free block onto a clear garbage.
if a location is not below a block then it is clear.
if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free.
load second-golf-sol.
if the value of a free block is less than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block.
if a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top.
if the value of a free block is more than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block.
the solution has nine steps.
