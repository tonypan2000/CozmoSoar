the name of the puzzle is eight-puzzle.
load init-8puzzlerc6.
ok.
if a block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
avoid moving a block that was previously moved.
the solution has six steps.
load final-8puzzlerc.
the goal is that eight of the locations are matched.
ok.
if the color of a location is the color of the block that is on the location then the location is matched.
done.
load init-8puzzlerc6.
yes.
