the name of the game is break-through.
load init-breakthrough.
ok.
you can move a red block onto a clear location that is capturable by the block.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if a captured location is under a clear location then the clear location is capturable by a block on the captured location.
if a location is below a red block then it is captured.
load fourth-breakthrough.
prefer moving a block onto a defendable location over moving a block onto a location that is not defendable.
if the number of captured locations supporting a clear location is more than one then the clear location is defendable.
if an object is attackable by a location then the location is supporting the object.
if a location is under an object and the location is diagonal with the object then the object is attackable by the location.
load second-breakthrough.
if an occupied location is attackable by a captured location then you can move a block on the occupied location onto a garbage and move another block on the captured location onto the occupied location.
if a location is below a blue block then it is occupied.
load final-breakthrough.
the goal is that a red location is captured.
ok.
load fail-breakthrough.
if a blue location is occupied then you lose.
ok.
done.
no.
