load init-tour.
ok.
if a clear location is movable from a red block then you can move the block onto the clear location and move a free clear blue block onto a location below the red block.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if a location that is adjacent to a red block is diagonal with an object that is not next to the red block then the object is movable from the red block.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
a block that is not on a location is free.
load final-tour.
