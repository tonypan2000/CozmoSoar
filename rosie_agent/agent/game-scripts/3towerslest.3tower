The name of the puzzle is tower-of-hanoi-3.
load init-tower3.
ok.
you can move a clear block onto a clear object that is larger than the block.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if the volume of a block is more than the volume of an object then the block is larger than the object.
avoid moving a block that was previously moved.
load final-tower3.
The goal is that the smallest block is on a medium block and the medium block is on a large block and the large block is on a blue location.
if a block is not larger than any object then the block is smallest.
ok.
done.
load init-tower3.
yes.
