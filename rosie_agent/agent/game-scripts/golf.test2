the name of the puzzle is golf-solitaire
load init-golf-sol
ok
you can move a free block onto a clear garbage,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free
load second-golf-sol
if the value of a free block is one less than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
if the value of a free block is one more than the value of a top block then you can move the free block onto the top block,if a block is clear and the position of the block is absent then it is free,if a location is not below an object then it is clear,if a block is clear and the position of the block is one then it is top
the solution has nine steps
load final-golf-sol
the goal is that all blocks are trashed,ok,if the position of a block is one then it is trashed
done
load init-golf-sol
yes
