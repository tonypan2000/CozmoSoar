the name of the puzzle is knights-tour.
load init-tour.
ok.
if a clear location is attackable by a knight then you can move the knight onto the clear location and move a free clear blue block onto a location below the knight.
a location that is not below an object is clear.
if a location that is adjacent to a knight is diagonal with an object that is not next to the knight then the object is attackable by the knight.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a block is red then it is a knight.
a block that is not on a location is free.
load final-tour.
the goal is that all locations are covered.
a location that is below an object is covered.
ok.
done.
load init-tour.
