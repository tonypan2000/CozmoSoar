ok.
you can write a number that is between zero and nine onto an empty location.
if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty.
the solution has three steps.
load final-shuffle.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
ok.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
load fail-shuffle.
if all locations are filled and the score of the green locations in a group is not the value of a location that is below the group then you lose.
ok.
if the blocks have the same column then they are in a group.
if a block is blue and the column of the block is the column of a location then the block is below the location.
the sum of the values of their blocks is the score of it.
if all locations are filled and the score of the green locations in a line is not the value of a location that is next to the line then you lose.
ok.
if the blocks have the same row then they are in a line.
if a block is blue and the row of the block is the row of a location then the block is next to the location.
