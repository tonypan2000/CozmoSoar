the name of the puzzle is eight-puzzle.
load init-8puzzle.
ok.
if a block is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
If a block is matched by a location then prefer moving the block onto the location.
if the color of a block is equal to the color of a location then the block is matched by the location.
load final-8puzzle.

if the color of a location is equal to the color of the block that is on the location then the location is matching.
