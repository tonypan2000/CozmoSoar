the name of the puzzle is ken-ken.
load init-ken-ken.
ok.
you can write a number that is between zero and four onto an empty location.
if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty.
the solution has four steps.
load fail-ken-ken2.
if the row of a location is the row of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
if the column of a location is the column of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
load fail-ken-ken.
if the score of the grouped locations is not ten then you lose.
the sum of the value of their blocks is the score of it.
if the blocks are filled and they have the same section then they are grouped.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
ok.
load fail-ken-ken2.
prefer writing a number onto an empty location over writing a number onto an empty object that is larger than the empty location.
if the constraints of a location is less than the constraints of an object then the location is larger than the object.
the number of their empty locations that are matched by an object is the constraints of it.
if the column of a block is the column of a location then the block is matched by the location.
load final-ken-ken.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
ok.
done.
load init-ken-ken.
yes.
