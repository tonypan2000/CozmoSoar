ok.
if an occupied location is adjacent to a clear location then you can move a block on the occupied location onto the clear location.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
if a location is below a blue block then it is occupied.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a covered location is between a clear location and an occupied location then you can move a block on the covered location onto the clear location plus move a block on the occupied location onto the covered location.
