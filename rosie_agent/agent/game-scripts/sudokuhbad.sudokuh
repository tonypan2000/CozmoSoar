if the total-constaints of an empty location is more than the total-constaints of another empty location then prefer writing on the former location.
the sum of the husband of a location and the column-constaints of the location and the section-constraints of the location is the total-constaints of the location.
if the row of a location is the row of the filled locations then the number of the filled locations is the husband of the location.
