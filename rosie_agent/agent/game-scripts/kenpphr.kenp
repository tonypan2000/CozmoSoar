load fail-ken-ken2.
if the row of a location is the row of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
if the column of a location is the column of a location and the value of the former location is the value of the latter location then you lose.
ok.
load fail-ken-ken.
if the score of the grouped locations is not twenty-four then you lose.
the product of the value of their blocks is the score of it.
if the blocks are filled and they have the same section then they are grouped.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
ok.
load init-ken-ken.
prefer writing a number onto a location over writing a number onto an object that is higher than the location.
if the row of a location is more than the row of an object then the location is higher than the object.
load final-ken-ken.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
ok.
done.
