the name of the puzzle is shuffle.
load init-shuffle.
ok.
you can write a number that is between zero and four onto an empty location.
if the value of a location is absent then the location is empty.
the solution has four steps.
load fail-shuffle.
if the value of a green location is the value of another green location then you lose.
ok.
if the score of the grouped locations is not the value of the result-square of the locations then you lose.
the sum of the value of their blocks is the score of it.
if the blocks that are green are filled and they have the same row then they are grouped.
if the value of a location is more than zero then the location is filled.
if the row of a location is the row of their grouped locations and the location is blue then it is the result-square of the grouped locations.
ok.
load final-shuffle.
the goal is that all locations are filled.
ok.
done.
load init-shuffle.
yes.
