the name of the puzzle is eight-puzzle.
load init-8puzzle.
ok.
if a block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a location is not below an object then it is clear.
load init-8puzzlex.
prefer moving a block onto a surrounded location over moving a block onto a location that is not surrounded.
if all the locations near a clear location are covered then the clear location is surrounded.
if a location is below a block then it is covered.
load final-8puzzle.
the goal is that there are eight matched locations.
if the color of a location is the color of the block that is on the location then the location is matched.
ok.
done.
no.
