the name of the puzzle is knights-tour.
load init-tour.
ok.
if a clear location is jumpable from an occupied location then you can move a red block onto the clear location and move a free clear blue block onto the occupied location.
a location that is not below an object is clear.
if a location that is adjacent to an occupied location is diagonal with an object that is not next to the occupied location then the object is jumpable from the occupied location.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
a location that is below a red block is occupied.
a block that is not on a location is free.
the solution has eleven steps.
