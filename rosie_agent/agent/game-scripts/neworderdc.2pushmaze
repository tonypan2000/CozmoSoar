the name of the puzzle is push-maze.
load init-pushmaze.
ok.
if a blue block is on a location that is adjacent to a clear location then you can move the block onto the clear location.
a location that is not below an object is clear.
if a location is next to an object but it is not diagonal with the object then it is adjacent to the object.
if a covered location is between a clear location and an occupied location then you can move a block on the covered location onto the clear location plus move a block on the occupied location onto the covered location.
a location that is below an object is covered.
a location that is below a blue block is occupied.
the solution has four steps.
load final-pushmaze.
the goal is that a blue block is on a blue location.
ok.
done.
load init-pushmaze.
yes.
