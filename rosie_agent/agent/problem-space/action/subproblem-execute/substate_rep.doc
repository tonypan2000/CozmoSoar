Operators:

	Subtasks
	copy-task-operator: no current-task-segment
	add-subtask-to-tcn: if the task-operator has an task-source instruction, learn a structure
		+learn-subtask-proposal
	pop-finished-action: when the child-task-segment has a status, pop it
	propose-child-task-segment: if there is a child task, propose it
	report-success: if the goal is achieved, mark success
	wait: if there is propose-wait on the state, propose it
	retrieve-lti: retrieve the smem lti for the action
	attend-to-scene-change: depends on the action



Ordering:
	If there is a child task, do that (nothing else)
