############################### task state-no-change ################################

These are really only triggered deliberately to help learn a chunk

1. learn-desired-elaboration-rule
  If there is a goal on the TCN, but no desired, then a state no-change will be triggered
  This will try to learn an elaboration rule to elaborate the task's goal (desired)

2. learn-subtask-proposal
  If there is a subtask on the TCN which is not proposed, then a state no-change will be triggered
  This will try to learn a proposal rule to propose the subtask

3. report-failure-unmatched-action
  A catch-all if a state no-change happens outside the previous 2, will terminate the task
