# general rules that have to deal with representing the subtasks in substates

problem-space.subtasks
	^copy-type << deep shallow >>
		Whether the subtasks copy is shallow (elaborates the same identifier)
			or deep (all substructure is deep copied)
	^source <subtasks>
		The subtasks to copy, if none is specified it defaults to superstate.subtasks
		
deep-copy-subtasks
	A structure created when the copy-type is deep
	Contains the following:
	
	source - the source subtasks to copy from
	copy - the new subtasks rep being deep copied (elaborated to state.subtasks)
	copy-subtasks-map - structure used to deep copy each subtask
		entry
			source <src-sub> The source object to copy 
			copy <new-sub>   The newly created copy of that subtask
